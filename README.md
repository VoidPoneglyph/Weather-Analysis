# Weather-Analysis
We've taken data for the weather changes in Perth, Australia every day for the last five years. Our goal is to create a working predictive model that predicts whether or not there is rain tomorrow in the city. First we change the data to a form that the neural network can work on. We remove NA values, strings and unecessary columnns of data. Then we begin splitting the data into training and testing while establishing the input and output of each. We fit both into a scaling funtion that changes the data so that the mean will be 0 and the standard deviation will be 1 so that the dataset given to the network is consistent. Then, using MLPClassifier, we train the data in question i.e; X_train and y_train. After this, we name a new variable "y_pred", that contains an array of predicted values that we got from using the .predict function on the test input data (X_test). An accuracy metric can be calculated using the accuracy_score() function comparing the y_pred values and the output test values (y_test).
